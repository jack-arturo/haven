# Haven on Etsy - Setup & Strategy Guide

## Overview

Etsy provides additional distribution channel for Haven products alongside your main website. This guide walks you through setting up an Etsy shop and maintaining consistency across both platforms.

## Why Etsy?

**Advantages:**
- Built-in audience of buyers searching for handmade goods
- 5-6% of Haven website traffic likely comes from Etsy awareness
- Lower risk than relying solely on direct website
- Etsy handles payment processing (you receive funds after Etsy fees)
- Built-in review system builds credibility

**Disadvantages:**
- Etsy takes ~5% + payment processing fees
- Less brand control (Etsy branding prominent)
- Algorithm changes affect visibility
- Must maintain shop reputation

## Step 1: Create Etsy Shop

1. Go to **etsy.com**
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Sell on Etsy"
4. Choose shop name: `HavenCoversCo` or `HavenMoroccan`
5. Complete shop setup:
   - Shop location
   - Shop policies
   - Payment method (where Etsy sends earnings)
   - Billing address

### Shop Name Recommendations
- `HavenCoversCo`
- `HavenCollection`
- `HavenMoroccan`
- `HavenTextiles`
- Avoid overly generic names

## Step 2: Set Up Shop Branding

### Shop Banner
1. Go to Shop Settings > Shop Sections
2. Create a custom shop banner:
   - Use same design aesthetic as website
   - Include tagline: "Reclaim Your Space"
   - Moroccan color palette
   - Link to website

### Shop Icon
- Use Haven logo (if you have one)
- Or use high-quality product photo
- Square format, 500x500px minimum

### Shop Announcement
```

## Step 7: Shop Optimization

### Etsy SEO Tips

**Keywords in Listing:**
- Title: Main keywords (moroccan, TV cover, handwoven)
- Tags: Long-tail keywords (boho home, artisan textile, etc.)
- Category: Select most relevant category
- Attributes: Fill all available options

**Best Performing Keywords:**
- "Moroccan textile"
- "Handmade TV cover"
- "Berber weaving"
- "Boho home decor"
- "Artisan made"
- "Geometric tapestry"

### Pricing for Discoverability
- Etsy algorithm favors items in mid-price range
- $247-$447 is good positioning
- Shows as premium but not luxury-only

### Shop Stats to Monitor
- **Views:** Target 50+ views per listing weekly
- **Favorites:** Track which products get favorited
- **Messages:** Respond within 24 hours
- **Sales:** Goal is 1-2 sales per week per pattern
- **Reviews:** Aim for 4.5+ stars average

## Step 8: Marketing Integration

### Link Website to Etsy

**On your Haven website:**
- Add "Also available on Etsy" link in footer
- Include Etsy shop link in About page
- Add Etsy badge to footer

**In Etsy shop:**
- Link to website: "Visit our website: havencollection.com"
- Add website URL in shop announcement
- Include in product description

### Cross-Promotion Strategy

**Website → Etsy:**
- Mention "Also available on Etsy" for price comparisons
- Some customers prefer Etsy's buyer protection
- Good for accessibility

**Etsy → Website:**
- "Join our mailing list" link in shop announcement
- "Subscribe for new patterns" in descriptions
- Build direct customer relationship

### Social Media

**Same content, both platforms:**
- New Etsy listing? Post to Instagram/Pinterest
- Website launch? Mention Etsy availability
- Use hashtags: #MoroccanTextile #TVCover #Handmade #Etsy

## Step 9: Manage Inventory

### Inventory Tracking

**Goal:** Keep inventory consistent between platforms

**Method:**
1. Use spreadsheet to track:
   - Product name
   - Size
   - Quantity available
   - Units sold (Etsy + Website)
   - Remaining stock

2. Example:
```
Product: Beni Ourain
Size 65": 50 units - 3 sold (2 Etsy, 1 website) = 47 remaining
Size 75": 50 units - 1 sold (Etsy) = 49 remaining
Size 85": 50 units - 0 sold = 50 remaining
```

3. Update Etsy quantity when stock changes
4. Pause listing if out of stock
5. Restock before relaunching

### Stock Management Options

**Option A: Manual tracking**
- Update Etsy and website as you make sales
- Spreadsheet-based
- Reliable but time-consuming

**Option B: Etsy's inventory sync**
- Some Etsy apps sync with external inventory
- More complex but automated
- Look into Etsy apps that offer this

**Option C: Separate inventory**
- Keep some inventory for website only
- Some for Etsy only
- More complex to manage

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (manual), scale to Option B later.

## Step 10: Customer Service

### Common Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What's the best size for my TV?**
```
A: Generally:
• 65": Best for TVs 55-65 inches
• 75": Best for TVs 65-75 inches
• 85": Best for TVs 75-85+ inches

The cover should be slightly larger than your TV. Measure your TV width and compare to the cover dimensions. Contact us if unsure!
```

**Q: Can I wash this?**
```
A: We recommend dry cleaning to maintain the pattern and color. Hand washing in cool water is possible but may affect the finish. The natural fibers will develop character and patina over time - this is part of the beauty.
```

**Q: How long does it last?**
```
A: With proper care, a Haven cover lasts 10+ years. The natural wool and cotton actually improve with age. Eventually it may develop wear, but it's built to last.
```

**Q: Is this really handmade?**
```
A: Yes! Each cover is handwoven by Moroccan artisans in small family workshops. No mass production. Every piece is unique.
